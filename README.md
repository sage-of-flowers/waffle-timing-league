# waffle timing league
this is a thing that will happen soon i think !
it is a (semi-private) event for ITG/StepMania where you play tech charts and get points

# Client
`npm i` then `npm run dev` in the `waffle-timing-league` directory

# Server
uhhhh good luck but just ask me how to set up the postgres db
otherwise `npm i` then `npx nodemon start`
